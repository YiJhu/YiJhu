## 👋 Hi, I'm Archibald  
**I build backend tools, APIs, and bots — clean code first, anime second.**

I focus on designing reliable backend software with an emphasis on
maintainability, performance, and long-term usability.

I care about code quality, architecture, and writing software that is
meant to survive refactors — not just demos.
